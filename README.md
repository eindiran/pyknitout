## On-Demand Machine Knitting for Everyone

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEaK68VRAng) is a very interesting video which discusses Knitout at length.

## The Knitout File Format

File extension: `.k`

Specification v0.5.3 can be found [here](https://textiles-lab.github.io/knitout/knitout.html).

Information from textile-labs is available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/textiles-lab/knitout).

## Future work

The `pyknitout` wrapper is currently very barebones. Future work should include fleshing out more convenience functionality, as well as adding some basic extensions. [This page](https://textiles-lab.github.io/knitout/extensions.html) shows the extensions to Knitout that are currently unsupported.
